                <p id="p-p1">Wassup Y’all,   
                    looks like this is my first time writing a blog post lol,
                    I don’t really know how to do this so I’ll just write about my life and my thoughts. If you don’t like it then don’t care. It all started when Stradlater was shaving. By the way let me tell you a little bit about this asshole.

                <p id="p-p2">
                Boy, was I mad. I keep on thinking about what Stardlater is going to try to do with her. He always tries to bang the girls he goes on a date with, because he is a football player. What do you expect? He is a man that likes ladies and that just wants to bang.

                <p id="p-p3">
                Stradlater and I just had a fight. As I knew, he beat me up. My nose was bleeding but it didn’t hurt I swear. That asshole was just too strong for me. I knew I shouldn’t have started that fight but boy was he acting so phony.
