        Boy, was I mad.
I keep on thinking about what Stardlater is going to try to do with her. He always tries to bang the girls he goes on a date with, because he is a football player. What do you expect? He is a man that likes ladies and that just wants to bang. Boy I hate those kinds of guys, I just wanna punch him and all I swear. At the end of the day I had to do his homework, but I kept thinking about the date and that just made me mad. I could barely write anything good, so his homework was going to be really bad. I mean I don’t care if the homework was poorly done I mean it ain't my problem. He asked me to do his homework and not to do it well. Man I’m so mad, I just want to beat him up. Even if I fight him I'd lose, but boy did I want to punch him right in the face. I kept on thinking about Jane. I think I might still like her. I remember the time we spent together that summer. Boy was I happy with her, I felt like she understood me and she wasn’t phony and all. Jane meant everything to me, knowing that Stradlater just disgusts me. Maybe I’m in love with her, but boy was I scared to tell her I swear.
