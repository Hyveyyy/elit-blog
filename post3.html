        Stradlater and I just had a fight. As I knew, he beat me up. My nose was bleeding but it didn’t hurt I swear. That asshole was just too strong for me. I knew I shouldn’t have started that fight but boy was he acting so phony. He also said things that were unpleasant, man I wanted to kill him at this point. He was just a self centered dickhead. When he came back, I gave him his homework and he was unhappy with it. Next time this dumbass should do it himself. I mean I didn’t put any effort into it but I still did it. I also didn’t like the way he would talk about Jane, she wasn’t an object. I called him a moron and then after I punched his ass, but then he knocked me out. I mean I expected that I’m really weak.  I was thinking of leaving the school after this event, boy did I hate this school.
