        Wassup Y’all
Looks like this is my first time writing a blog post lol,
I don’t really know how to do this so I’ll just write about my life and my thoughts. If you don’t like it then don’t care. It all started when Stradlater was shaving. By the way let me tell you a little bit about this asshole. Stradlater was a football player (means everything). I mean the guy is just a dickhead, he is the most phony looking guy on the earth, man I hate him my whole life I swear. The guy was popular and all, he was handsome (most of the girls thought that, but he secretly is a slob) and he was self-centered. This is quite the perfect description of one phony person I swear. Anyways back to my story, Stradlater was shaving in the bathroom with that rusty and disgusting shaver of his. I was sitting right next to him on the washbowl and then I wish he hadn’t opened his mouth when I look back at it he asks “You wanna do me a big favor”? Man I wished I would have said no, but I had agreed to him. Man, why did I have to be such a nice guy. Anyways, what was I saying? Oh yes, well I said yes because well why not and I was also being dumb. Stradlater was going out, that's why he asked me to do his homework. I had agreed because I had nothing better to do with my life, and I liked doing English homework. English was my favorite subject at school. It was also the only class I was passing at this dumb school. I was going to Pencey Prep, my 4th school. I was kicked out of the other ones. Pencey Prep was the worst school that I attended because it was filled with a bunch of phony ass people. I was thinking of leaving it, because why not. Anyways, Stradlater was gonna go out with a chick that he’d probably try to bang after their phony date. I was kinda curious so I asked him who he was gonna go out with. Here is the worst part, he was going out with Jane Gallagher. This was my worst nightmare. If you don’t know who Jane Gallagher is, she is a girl that I had spent my whole summer with. She was the most attractive girl I'd met and I quite liked her too. At the end of the day I couldn’t say anything about it and I just had to let him go on his date. That evening I spent it all just thinking about their little date, boy I was mad.
